# Cleaning Data with Case Statements
* We will be looking at the freight column from the orders table. The Freight column uses a money data type, it represents the freight rate for items or goods.

## Explanation
* Within the freight column we have data for each order followed by it's cost. As seen in image 1, we have row 1 with a charge of 32.38.
* A method for data cleaning used is the case statement. The case statement sets conditions and if the condition is met then it will essentially return a value if the condition is met. (Same concept as case statements in Java)
* After using the case statement we can see it essentially groups the cost into categories which are established through the condition.
