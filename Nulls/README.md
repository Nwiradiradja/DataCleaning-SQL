# Dealing with NULLs in SQL
* Using the ISNULL function to handle nulls in SQL
* ISNULL function is a tool to handle NULL values in database management

## Explanation
* Were going to run a sample Query from the Customer table, were going to take a look at the CustomerID, ContactName, City and Region. As seen in image 1 when we run the query the Region column is filled with Null Values. Meaning that there is no region assigned to that customer.
* To deal with this issue and essentially clean the data, we are going to use the ISNULL function as seen in image 2. For the CustomerID that has no region assigned to it is given the value of 'No Region'.
* However we are not finished yet, there still exist a region column with null values, the column to the right of region is what we want to make the data clean.
* To do so we remove Region from our select statement and basically assign the column name of Region to the column generated by the ISNULL statement as seen in image 3.
